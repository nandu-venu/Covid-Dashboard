Metrics
	>> Death/million population
	>> CFR = Deaths/(recovered+deaths)
	>> Test rate = Test/day
	>> Vaccination Rates = Vaccines/100 people
	>> TPR = Cases/Tests
	>> Weekly averages of cases, recoveries, deaths, vaccinations
	>> Weekly growth rate
	>> Peak indicator = If the weekly average higher than last week but less than preceding week >> Extract all such weeks
	>> Trough indicator = Opposite of the above
	>> Trough to peak
